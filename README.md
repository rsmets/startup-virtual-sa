# aws-dev-toolkit

A Claude Code plugin for AWS development. Ships 30 skills, 11 sub-agents, 3 MCP servers, and hooks that help you build well-architected applications on AWS.

## Quick Start

```bash
# Add the marketplace
claude plugins marketplace add rsmets/aws-dev-toolkit

# Install the plugin
claude plugins install aws-dev-toolkit
```

Or test locally during development:

```bash
claude --plugin-dir ./plugins/aws-dev-toolkit
```

> **Note**: `--plugin-dir` loads the plugin from disk at **session start**. File changes are picked up on the next session — not live. `/plugin update` does not work for local plugins (it requires a marketplace source). Restart Claude Code to pick up changes. See [Plugins Guide](https://code.claude.com/docs/en/plugins) for details.

## Usage

Once installed, the plugin's skills, agents, and MCP servers are available automatically in Claude Code. Here's how each piece works:

### Skills (Automatic)

Skills activate automatically based on context — no special commands needed. Just ask naturally:

```
"Review this architecture for Well-Architected best practices"  → aws-architect
"Why is my CloudFormation stack failing?"                       → aws-debug
"How much is this infrastructure costing me?"                   → cost-check
"Are there security issues in my Terraform?"                    → security-review
"Estimate Bedrock costs for 50k daily invocations"              → bedrock-cost
"I want to build a serverless API for processing images"        → aws-plan
"Compare ECS vs EKS for my workload"                            → aws-compare
"Show me a diagram of this architecture"                        → aws-diagram
"We're moving from GCP to AWS"                                  → aws-migrate
```

### Slash Commands

Some skills are invoked explicitly via slash commands:

```
/aws-dev-toolkit:iac-scaffold terraform "VPC with public/private subnets and NAT"
/aws-dev-toolkit:iac-scaffold cdk "Serverless API with Lambda and DynamoDB"
/aws-dev-toolkit:aws-health-check us-east-1
/aws-dev-toolkit:aws-diagram from-iac
/aws-dev-toolkit:aws-migrate gcp
```

### Sub-Agents (Automatic)

Sub-agents are spun up automatically when Claude determines a specialist is needed. You can also invoke them directly:

```
"Explore my AWS environment and summarize what's deployed"      → aws-explorer
"Run a Well-Architected review on my production workload"       → well-architected-reviewer
"Review my IaC changes before I deploy"                         → iac-reviewer
"Help me plan a migration from Azure to AWS"                    → migration-advisor
"Help me pick the right Bedrock model for classification"       → bedrock-sme
"I have a PoC agent, help me productionize it"                  → agentcore-sme
"Should I use ECS or EKS for this workload?"                    → container-sme
"Help me optimize my AWS bill"                                  → cost-optimizer
```

### MCP Servers

The plugin ships 3 MCP servers. In Kiro, MCP configs are not auto-loaded from the plugin directory — you need to add them to your Kiro MCP settings.

Add to `~/.kiro/settings/mcp.json` (user-level) or `.kiro/settings/mcp.json` (workspace-level):

```jsonc
{
  "mcpServers": {
    // AWS IaC validation and security scanning
    "awsiac": {
      "command": "uvx",
      "args": ["awslabs.aws-iac-mcp-server@latest"],
      "env": { "FASTMCP_LOG_LEVEL": "ERROR" },
      "disabled": false
    },
    // AWS documentation, recommendations, and regional availability
    "awsknowledge": {
      "type": "http",
      "url": "https://knowledge-mcp.global.api.aws",
      "disabled": false
    },
    // AWS pricing data and cost analysis
    "awspricing": {
      "command": "uvx",
      "args": ["awslabs.aws-pricing-mcp-server@latest"],
      "env": { "FASTMCP_LOG_LEVEL": "ERROR" },
      "timeout": 120000,
      "disabled": false
    }
  }
}
```

These are used behind the scenes by skills and agents — you don't need to invoke them directly.

| Server | Type | Package / URL | Description |
|---|---|---|---|
| `awsiac` | stdio | `awslabs.aws-iac-mcp-server` | CDK/Terraform/CloudFormation development with security scanning |
| `awsknowledge` | http | `https://knowledge-mcp.global.api.aws` | AWS documentation search, service recommendations, and regional availability |
| `awspricing` | stdio | `awslabs.aws-pricing-mcp-server` | AWS service pricing data, cost reports, and IaC cost analysis |

### Hooks

Hooks run automatically on events. Currently configured:

- After editing an IaC file (`.tf`, `template.yaml`, `*-stack.ts`, etc.), Claude reminds you to validate before deploying

### Example Workflows

**"I need a new service on AWS"**
1. Describe what you're building — `aws-plan` kicks in automatically
2. Answer 3-5 discovery questions (it won't overwhelm you)
3. Review the proposed architecture, security findings, and cost estimate
4. Scaffold it — `/iac-scaffold cdk "your description"`
5. Edit the generated code — the hook reminds you to `cdk synth && cdk diff`

**"Should I use Lambda or Fargate?"**
1. Describe your workload — `aws-compare` evaluates both side-by-side
2. Get a comparison table across cost, complexity, performance, and team fit
3. Receive an opinionated recommendation tied to your constraints

**"What does this architecture look like?"**
1. Ask for a diagram — `/aws-diagram from-iac` reverse-engineers your IaC files
2. Or describe the architecture — it generates Mermaid + ASCII diagrams

**"Is my AWS account in good shape?"**
1. Run `/aws-health-check us-east-1`
2. Get a quick score with critical findings, warnings, and quick wins
3. See SCP recommendations if baseline guardrails are missing

**"My Bedrock agent is too expensive"**
1. Ask about your Bedrock usage — `bedrock-sme` analyzes your patterns
2. Get model selection guidance — it'll steer you toward the cheapest model that works
3. Ask `cost-check` to look at your overall AWS bill for context

**"I built a PoC agent, now what?"**
1. Share your agent code — `agentcore-sme` reviews it against the production checklist
2. Get guidance on adding DeepEval for model evaluation
3. Choose between AgentCore native observability or Langfuse
4. Walk through the PoC → production migration path

**"Run a Well-Architected review on my workload"**
1. The `well-architected-reviewer` agent scans your AWS environment
2. Evaluates each of the six pillars with real CLI evidence
3. Rates findings as HRI (high risk), MRI (medium risk), or LRI (low risk)
4. Produces a structured report with prioritized remediation steps
5. Use the `awsknowledge` MCP server for AWS documentation and best-practice references

**"We're moving from GCP to AWS"**
1. Describe your GCP environment — `gcp-to-aws` maps services to AWS equivalents
2. Run the assessment commands to inventory what's deployed
3. Review the gotchas for your specific services (global VPCs, Spanner, BigQuery)
4. Use `iac-scaffold` to generate the target AWS infrastructure
5. Ask `migration-advisor` for wave planning and cutover strategy

**"We're moving from Azure to AWS"**
1. Describe your Azure environment — `azure-to-aws` maps services to AWS equivalents
2. Run az CLI discovery commands to inventory resources
3. Pay special attention to identity migration (Azure AD → IAM Identity Center)
4. Review Cosmos DB and Synapse migration paths (these are complex)
5. Use `iac-scaffold` to generate the target AWS infrastructure

**"I have an idea for something on AWS"**
1. Describe your idea — `customer-ideation` guides you through discovery
2. Answer the structured questions about requirements and constraints
3. Review the proposed architecture with Well-Architected checklist
4. Use `/iac-scaffold` to generate starter infrastructure code
5. Ask for a cost estimate before committing

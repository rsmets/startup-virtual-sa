# sup-virtual-sa

A Claude Code plugin marketplace for AWS development. Ships skills, sub-agents, MCP servers, and hooks that help you build well-architected applications on AWS.

## Quick Start

```bash
# Add the marketplace
/plugin marketplace add <your-git-url>

# Install the AWS dev toolkit
/plugin install aws-dev-toolkit@sup-virtual-sa
```

Or test locally during development:

```bash
claude --plugin-dir ./plugins/aws-dev-toolkit
```

## Usage

Once installed, the plugin's skills, agents, and MCP servers are available automatically in Claude Code. Here's how each piece works:

### Skills (Automatic)

Skills activate automatically based on context — no special commands needed. Just ask naturally:

```
"Review this architecture for Well-Architected best practices"  → aws-architect
"Why is my CloudFormation stack failing?"                       → aws-debug
"How much is this infrastructure costing me?"                   → cost-check
"Are there security issues in my Terraform?"                    → security-review
"Estimate Bedrock costs for 50k daily invocations"              → bedrock-cost
```

The one exception is `iac-scaffold`, which uses a slash command:

```
/iac-scaffold terraform "VPC with public/private subnets and NAT"
/iac-scaffold cdk "Serverless API with Lambda and DynamoDB"
```

### Sub-Agents (Automatic)

Sub-agents are spun up automatically when Claude determines a specialist is needed. You can also invoke them directly:

```
"Explore my AWS environment and summarize what's deployed"      → aws-explorer
"Review my IaC changes before I deploy"                         → iac-reviewer
"Help me pick the right Bedrock model for classification"       → bedrock-sme
"I have a PoC agent, help me productionize it"                  → agentcore-sme
```

### MCP Servers

The plugin references several AWS MCP servers. In Kiro, MCP configs are not auto-loaded from the plugin directory — you need to add them to your Kiro MCP settings.

Add to `~/.kiro/settings/mcp.json` (user-level) or `.kiro/settings/mcp.json` (workspace-level):

```jsonc
{
  "mcpServers": {
    // AWS IaC validation and security scanning
    "aws-iac": {
      "command": "uvx",
      "args": ["awslabs.aws-iac-mcp-server@latest"],
      "env": { "FASTMCP_LOG_LEVEL": "ERROR" },
      "disabled": false
    },
    // AWS documentation search
    "aws-docs": {
      "command": "uvx",
      "args": ["awslabs.aws-documentation-mcp-server@latest"],
      "env": { "FASTMCP_LOG_LEVEL": "ERROR" },
      "disabled": false
    },
    // Core AWS resource access
    "aws-core": {
      "command": "uvx",
      "args": ["awslabs.core-mcp-server@latest"],
      "env": { "FASTMCP_LOG_LEVEL": "ERROR", "AWS_PROFILE": "default" },
      "disabled": false
    },
    // Cost analysis
    "aws-cost": {
      "command": "uvx",
      "args": ["awslabs.cost-analysis-mcp-server@latest"],
      "env": { "FASTMCP_LOG_LEVEL": "ERROR", "AWS_PROFILE": "default" },
      "disabled": false
    }
  }
}
```

These are used behind the scenes by skills and agents — you don't need to invoke them directly.

| Server | Package | Description |
|---|---|---|
| `aws-iac` | `awslabs.aws-iac-mcp-server` | CDK/Terraform/CloudFormation development with security scanning |
| `aws-docs` | `awslabs.aws-documentation-mcp-server` | Latest AWS documentation and code samples |
| `aws-core` | `awslabs.core-mcp-server` | Proxy server that dynamically imports other AWS MCP servers |
| `aws-cost` | `awslabs.cost-analysis-mcp-server` | Cost analysis and optimization |

### Hooks

Hooks run automatically on events. Currently configured:

- After editing an IaC file (`.tf`, `template.yaml`, `*-stack.ts`, etc.), Claude reminds you to validate before deploying

### Example Workflows

**"I need a new service on AWS"**
1. Describe what you're building — `aws-architect` kicks in with a design
2. Ask to scaffold it — `/iac-scaffold cdk "your description"`
3. Edit the generated code — the hook reminds you to `cdk synth && cdk diff`
4. Ask for a security review before deploying

**"My Bedrock agent is too expensive"**
1. Ask about your Bedrock usage — `bedrock-sme` analyzes your patterns
2. Get model selection guidance — it'll steer you toward the cheapest model that works
3. Ask `cost-check` to look at your overall AWS bill for context

**"I built a PoC agent, now what?"**
1. Share your agent code — `agentcore-sme` reviews it against the production checklist
2. Get guidance on adding DeepEval for model evaluation
3. Choose between AgentCore native observability or Langfuse
4. Walk through the PoC → production migration path
